A new era is coming, and it’s time we leave Biden’s hateful era behind. Will President-elect Trump be safe from attackers on Inauguration Day? Trump has hired his own private security team in preparation for the big day. SCOTUS upheld the TikTok ban, but Biden announced he would not enforce it and will let Trump handle it when he takes office. Should the ban go through? Cinematographer and director of “Hotshot” Gabriel Kirkpatrick Mann joins to discuss the documentary he made exposing California’s true history of wildfires, which he released independently after multiple streaming services declined to release it due to its message. Author Brad Meltzer joins to discuss his newest book, “The JFK Conspiracy,” which exposes the untold story of the failed plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy before his inauguration. Brad and Glenn also discuss the potential validity of a tape that implicates Lyndon B. Johnson as being behind the actual assassination of JFK and the conspiracy theories surrounding presidential assassinations.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

The most extreme reaction comes from Trump and a growing number of Republicans in Congress, who are already talking about placing conditions on disaster relief for California. Meanwhile, President Biden kicks off his final week in office with a farewell speech defending his foreign policy legacy. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down what he got right, and what’s at risk as Trump returns to D.C. On another front, MAGA’s messy relationship with Big Tech heats up. Zuckerberg sits down with Trump on Joe Rogan, while Steve Bannon takes aim at Elon Musk. Finally, Ken Martin, Chair the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, drops by to talk about his campaign for Chair of the Democratic National Committee.",

In this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Glenn is joined by icon-carver and public intellectual Jonathan Pageau for a discussion of aliens, angels, fairy tales, Disney, Christian art, the Bible, and even Christmas trees. Jonathan breaks down Tucker Carlson’s account of being attacked by a demon, and Glenn shares the story of his first death threat and being given the gift of spiritual discernment. In a conversation that quickly goes interdimensional, the two men wrestle with the nature of evil, the “otherworldly” feel of global government, and even the school of witchcraft in Jonathan’s neighborhood in Canada. \n \nTo follow Jonathan’s work, visit: https://www.thesymbolicworld.com/. \n \n       \nSponsors    \n\nRelief Factor     \nRelief Factor can help you live pain-free!

                                "standard": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, President Biden can’t leave the office quick enough. He now claims to have amended the Constitution. Biden announced that the Equal Rights Amendment is the “law of the land,” despite the Justice Department and the U.S. archivist saying the President could not ratify the Constitutional amendment. Biden is lawless then he lectures us about the rule of law. According to Democrats, you can do anything if it’s in pursuit of the radical left agenda. Also, Ambassador Danny Danon calls in to discuss the Israel/Hamas ceasefire. This is not a peace agreement; Israel keeps the right to go into Gaza and finish off Hamas if necessary. Danon says they are determined to finish the job but will pause to get the hostages back.  Later, Democrats keep telling us we have to fix our immigration laws, but they’re not broken.  We have very detailed immigration laws which work if they are enforced. The problem is Democrats lack of virtue and lack of execution - its intentional.  It will be important to have a Governor in the DHS position – Kristi Noem will be fantastic. Afterward, a unanimous Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban. It can still survive; it just needs new American ownership. We can’t allow China to control Americans' data.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
